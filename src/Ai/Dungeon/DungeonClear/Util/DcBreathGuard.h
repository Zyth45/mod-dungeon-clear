// Breath. Nothing else in the module knows a bot can drown: the party gate,
// the rests and the "Holding near" parks all happily keep a party under water
// until the 180 s breath bar runs out, and on Blackfathom Deeps that was every
// run (members dying with no opponent every ~190 s in the flooded passage to
// Lady Sarevess, and in the pool under Kelris).
//
// Two halves:
//   * AnyMemberUnderWater: the gates ask it, so a party is never held under
//     water waiting for a straggler or a rest;
//   * Tick (world thread, every sweep): a bot of a running clear that has been
//     under water, out of combat, for longer than half its breath is brought
//     back up beside its leader, or to the leader's last dry spot when the
//     leader is under water too.
